    "## When should I build my own algorithm container?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not need to create a container to bring your own code to Amazon SageMaker. When you are using a framework such as Apache MXNet or TensorFlow that has direct support in SageMaker, you can simply supply the Python code that implements your algorithm using the SDK entry points for that framework. This set of supported frameworks is regularly added to, so you should check the current list to determine whether your algorithm is written in one of these common machine learning environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there is direct SDK support for your environment or framework, you may find it more effective to build your own container. If the code that implements your algorithm is quite complex or you need special additions to the framework, building your own container may be the right choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons to build an already supported framework container are:\n",
    "1. A specific version isn't supported.\n",
    "2. Configure and install your dependencies and environment.\n",
    "3. Use a different training/hosting solution than provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough shows that it is quite straightforward to build your own container. So you can still use SageMaker even if your use case is not covered by the deep learning containers that we've built for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook requires permissions in addition to the normal `SageMakerFullAccess` permissions. This is because it creates new repositories in Amazon ECR. The easiest way to add these permissions is simply to add the managed policy `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` to the role that you used to start your notebook instance. There's no need to restart your notebook instance when you do this, the new permissions will be available immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we show how to package a custom TensorFlow container with a Python example which works with the CIFAR-10 dataset and uses TensorFlow Serving for inference. However, different inference solutions other than TensorFlow Serving can be used by modifying the docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a single image to support training and hosting. This simplifies the procedure because we only need to manage one image for both tasks. Sometimes you may want separate images for training and hosting because they have different requirements. In this case, separate the parts discussed below into separate Dockerfiles and build two images. Choosing whether to use a single image or two images is a matter of what is most convenient for you to develop and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're only using Amazon SageMaker for training or hosting, but not both, only the functionality used needs to be built into your container.\n",

    "### An overview of Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with Docker already, you can skip ahead to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many data scientists, Docker containers are a new technology. But they are not difficult and can significantly simply the deployment of your software packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a simple way to package arbitrary code into an _image_ that is totally self-contained. Once you have an image, you can use Docker to run a _container_ based on that image. Running a container is just like running a program on the machine except that the container creates a fully self-contained environment for the program to run. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host environment, so the way your program is set up is the way it runs, no matter where you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is more powerful than environment managers like conda or virtualenv because (a) it is completely language independent and (b) it comprises your whole operating environment, including startup commands, and environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Docker container is like a virtual machine, but it is much lighter weight. For example, a program running in a container can start in less than a second and many containers can run simultaneously on the same physical or virtual machine instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker uses a simple file called a `Dockerfile` to specify how the image is assembled. An example is provided below. You can build your Docker images based on Docker images built by yourself or by others, which can simplify things quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker has become very popular in programming and devops communities due to its flexibility and its well-defined specification of how code can be run in its containers. It is the underpinning of many services built in the past few years, such as [Amazon ECS].\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses Docker to allow users to train and deploy arbitrary algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Amazon SageMaker, Docker containers are invoked in a one way for training and another, slightly different, way for hosting. The following sections outline how to build containers for the SageMaker environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful links:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Docker home page](http://www.docker.com)\n",
    "* [Getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n",
    "* [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)\n",

    "### How Amazon SageMaker runs your Docker container\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you can run the same image in training or hosting, Amazon SageMaker runs your container with the argument `train` or `serve`. How your container processes this argument depends on the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this example, we don't define an `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile so Docker runs the command [`train` at training time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo.html) and [`serve` at serving time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html). In this example, we define these as executable Python scripts, but they could be any program that we want to start in that environment.\n",
    "* If you specify a program as an `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile, that program will be run at startup and its first argument will be `train` or `serve`. The program can then look at that argument and decide what to do.\n",
    "* If you are building separate containers for training and hosting (or building only for one or the other), you can define a program as an `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile and ignore (or verify) the first argument passed in. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running your container during training\n",
    "\n",
    "When Amazon SageMaker runs training, your `train` script is run, as in a regular Python program. A number of files are laid out for your use, under the `/opt/ml` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    /opt/ml\n",
    "    |-- input\n",
    "    |   |-- config\n",
    "    |   |   |-- hyperparameters.json\n",

    "    `-- output\n",
    "        `-- failure\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The input\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/input/config` contains information to control how your program runs. `hyperparameters.json` is a JSON-formatted dictionary of hyperparameter names to values. These values are always strings, so you may need to convert them. `resourceConfig.json` is a JSON-formatted file that describes the network layout used for distributed training.\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/input/data/<channel_name>/` (for File mode) contains the input data for that channel. The channels are created based on the call to CreateTrainingJob but it's generally important that channels match algorithm expectations. The files for each channel are copied from S3 to this directory, preserving the tree structure indicated by the S3 key structure. \n",
    "* `/opt/ml/input/data/<channel_name>_<epoch_number>` (for Pipe mode) is the pipe for a given epoch. Epochs start at zero and go up by one each time you read them. There is no limit to the number of epochs that you can run, but you must close each pipe before reading the next epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The output\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/model/` is the directory where you write the model that your algorithm generates. Your model can be in any format that you want. It can be a single file or a whole directory tree. SageMaker packages any files in this directory into a compressed tar archive file. This file is made available at the S3 location returned in the `DescribeTrainingJob` result.\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/output` is a directory where the algorithm can write a file `failure` that describes why the job failed. The contents of this file are returned in the `FailureReason` field of the `DescribeTrainingJob` result. For jobs that succeed, there is no reason to write this file as it is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running your container during hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting has a very different model than training because hosting is reponding to inference requests that come in via HTTP. In this example, we use [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/), however the hosting solution can be customized. One example is the [Python serving stack within the scikit learn example](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own/scikit_bring_your_own.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "* `/ping` receives `GET` requests from the infrastructure. Your program returns 200 if the container is up and accepting requests.\n",
    "* `/invocations` is the endpoint that receives client inference `POST` requests. The format of the request and the response is up to the algorithm. If the client supplied `ContentType` and `Accept` headers, these are passed in as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The container has the model files in the same place that they were written to during training:\n",

    "* __`cifar10`__ is the directory which contains the files that are installed in the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple application, we install only five files in the container. You may only need that many, but if you have many supporting routines, you may wish to install more. These five files show the standard structure of our Python containers, although you are free to choose a different toolset and therefore could have a different layout. If you're writing in a different programming language, you will have a different layout depending on the frameworks and tools you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files that we put in the container are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __`cifar10.py`__ is the program that implements our training algorithm.\n",
    "* __`resnet_model.py`__ is the program that contains our Resnet model. \n",
    "* __`nginx.conf`__ is the configuration file for the nginx front-end. Generally, you should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "* __`serve`__ is the program started when the container is started for hosting. It simply launches nginx and loads your exported model with TensorFlow Serving.\n",
    "* __`train`__ is the program that is invoked when the container is run for training. Our implementation of this script invokes cifar10.py with our our hyperparameter values retrieved from /opt/ml/input/config/hyperparameters.json. The goal for doing this is to avoid having to modify our training algorithm program.\n",

    "In summary, the two files you probably want to change for your application are `train` and `serve`."
