    "# Finetuning PyTorch BERT with NGC\n",
    "The BERT family of models are a powerful set of natural language understanding models based on the transformer architecture originating from the paper Attention Is All You Need, which you can find here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\n",
    "\n",
    "These models work by running unsupervised pre-training on massive sets of text data. This process requires an enormous amount of time and compute. Luckily for us, BERT models are built for transfer learning. BERT models are able to be finetuned to perform many different NLU tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to download a BERT base model and finetune this model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset and walk through the steps necessary to deploy it to a Sagemaker endpoint."

      "\n",
      "Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. \n",

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .

[SEP] as at most other universities , notre dame ' s students run a number of news media outlets . the nine student - run outlets include three newspapers , both a radio and television station , and several magazines and journals . begun as a one - page journal in september 1876 , the scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the united states . the other magazine , the jug ##gler , is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork . the dome yearbook is published annually . the newspapers have varying publication interests , with the observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news , and staffed by students from both notre dame and saint mary ' s college . unlike scholastic and the dome , the observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university . in 1987 , when some students believed that the observer began to show a conservative bias , a liberal newspaper , common sense was published . likewise , in 2003 , when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias , the conservative paper irish rover went into production . neither paper is published as often as the observer ; however , all three are distributed to all students . finally , in spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research , beyond politics , made its debut .
